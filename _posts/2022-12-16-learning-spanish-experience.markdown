# My experiences learning Spanish

This entry talks about my experiences learning Spanish.

## Motivations for Learning

My motivations in learning spanish was driven by my desire to learn bitcoin and also my coworkers. 

Bitcoin is growing amongst spanish speakers. In places like El Salvador, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Costa Rica they are small pockets of communities that are saving in Bitcoin. This was one motivation I had when I started learning. Also, at work my coworkers are speak spanish so it only made sense that I try to level up my Spanish.

In high school, I took 4 years of Spanish so it only made sense as it was a low hanging fruit.

## Buying Grammar Book

I am a structured learner so buying a grammar book to learn was a no brainer. Below is the book I used. In my opinion it is an essential tool to learn the grammar.

## Enroll in class

Having a tutor is also a great way to fast track in being fluent. You can learn to speak the language and not sound too proper. But you have to pick and choose a country in which you want to learn Spanish as it is spoken a bit differently in various countries.

## Emersion (books, television, music)

The reason why it is important to emerse yourself in books, television and music is to get an ear for the language. In my opinion it is difficult to build this ear as words tend to sound the same. Even to this day, it takes me some time to process. It is easier to speak than it is to listen.

## Incremental Bits of Info

It is very important to keep up with your practice because it's true, if you don't use it; you lose it. So make time to keep practicing even if it is a little.

## Comprehensive Input

This is an exercise to listen a audio or video and translate it by writing it down on paper. This will help you build an ear for the langauge.
