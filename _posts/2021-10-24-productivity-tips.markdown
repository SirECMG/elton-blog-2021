# Productivity Tips

In this post I am going to discuss some tips that has helped me become a productive person. These tips will include software and general advice.

## Microsoft Todo App

Ideally, pen and paper was my goto way of getting things done on a regular basis. I actually prefer this way as the act of writing things down allows my brain to register all tasks I need to do in the short and long term. It allows me to focus.

The downside is that I need to physically carry a notebook everywhere and I am not able to conviently jot down all the things I want to get done.

To solve this problem, I landed using Microsoft Todo after many different attempts on finding a good todo app. 

One reason why I like to use this application is because the application from a ui and functionality aspect is very simple and powerful.

It also integrates with Outlook in a way that's a game changer in my opinion.

## how do I organize my tasks
I organize my Todo list into two buckets. Work and Personal. I used to used one, but definitely it is not scaling as I need more things to do. 

The Work and Personal list act as backlogs. Then I use the "My Day" feature as my queue on what work I will be doing for that day.

When creating a task todo, the idea is to keep the task as high level as possible and use the subtask for more detailed items. 

If a task is too high level, I notice the work does not get done. The path to successful completion needs clarity.

## commonly used features I use

The common features I use to reenforce getting the work done is due dates and reminders. These are alerts to capture your attention. They tell you that something needs attention and does a good job of emphasizing and notifying you (from every device). The notifications Microsoft Todo alerts are annoying, and resisting the urge to ignore them is a personal challenge, but I am grateful this feature exist.

## ability to see todo on any device
Having constant visiblity on the backlog of tasks is important. One of the main reason why we are productive using a pen and notebook is that tasks are always visible. Leveraging technology makes it so that we can see information multiple screens. It is also, more "green" to compared to using paper.

## ability to share lists

Microsoft todo also allows other people to see your personal list by sharing it via a web link. This will give people the ability to view or edit the list. Which can be powerful as it can act as a project management tool. I use this to assign task from my work (Microsoft) and person account (live.com)

## ability to assign list
I use this feature to assign tasks between my personal and work. It can also be used like a project management feature giving it a team aspect.

## Microsoft Outlook Calendar

More and more I've been using Microsoft Outlook to manage my future calendar. Using a calendar gives me a heads up on all the tasks head.

## outlook app integrates with todo on week view
The benefits of using Outlook is that the week view calendar allows you to see what tasks are on your Todo app if you assign them a due date.

Outlook also provides regular email and a great filtering mechanisms.

## Light Lunches

## how did I come about having lighter lunches?

As I got older, I noticed that more and more that if I ate a large lunch I would get a food coma, sleep in the afternoon. It was almost inevitable.

To counter this, I began eating less rice. White rice was something I ate in large amounts for lunch and dinner and lately, I have completely removed it from my diet. Or at least eating very minimal. My goal is to eat way more nutricious foods, rather than comfort food. It is important to regulate energy levels.

## how I felt after it a couple weeks in

For time, I've been getting less sleepy. This results in higher energy levels in the afternoons and also I've loss less weight. I am 6'3 and was 210 pounds in the height of the pandemic staying home. After, I've cut my weight by eliminating rice completely. Now I am down to a good 198-200 pounds.

## Do the first thing that pops in your mind

## what I noticed about my habits
For this, I notice that I would thing of an idea in my head that I'd either want to do and not write it down. Next that thought that I had, resulted in miss opportunities. So a lesson learned from my last Team Lead Alula, was to either write it down immediately or do the item first in your head before you forget!

## Switch between 2-3 tasks

## how to stay entertained but still be productive
From my experience, the longer you do the same thing over and over again the more you get bored. In order to prevent this from happening, you need to have several avenues to keep you busy. Either you can use this time to relax and enjoy the moment or you can look into doing something else and come back to the original task at hand. It is not multitasking, but keeping your mind active.

## Pomodoro Technqiue

## how I manage my energy using pomodoros
In order to keep your energy levels, you need work in burst of energies. We have seen pomodoros being used over and over again in articles. But if you actually use it in practice it helps so much. What I personally do is I devote 25 minutes of heads down working time, but I use 10-15 minute breaks in between to stay grounded and not get lost in tangent. This gradular approach has given me enough energy to push through for task I don't really want to do. The important thing to do is to stick with it and push through. Completely focus at the current task at hand.

## does pomodoro work?

Does it work? From my experience, by sticking with pomodoro religiously it works! On a good day you can knockout 6-8 pomodoros. And it is good for repetitive task. With harder task, you might need to have longer time durations.

## Managing Notifications

Whether you have Android or iOS I leverage the fact that we have the ability to use notificaions. Notifications can be extremely useful if you curate the good and leave out the bad. What does that mean? If you only allow messages that need to reach you, it can be extremely useful for you to stay on top of things.

Having a higher level view of what is going on can be great for productivity. But don't let notifications fight for your attention. You have control over notifications. If you feel overwhelm you can mute it or clear all. The goal is to keep you in the loop. This can be down during downtimes. But the goal is to stay in control!

If you do this you can have a lot of benefits. Maybe every top of the hour can you clear out notifications.

## Accept the Identity of a Productive Person

By self proclaiming yourself as a productive person brings accountablity into play. Also, you need to convince yourself you are productive to build that character. Having confidence in yourself that you are productive also helps! Any approach helps, fake it 'til you make it! But be relentless in identifying yourself without a doubt that you are productive.

## Windows vs Mac Productivity

This is a personal preference. A little about my background I have been using almost every operating system on a regular basis since the beginning of 2010. I went from Ubuntu, to different flavors of linux to MacOS professionally and Windows.

I am a developer by profession and have concluded in 2021 that Windows 10/11 is way more productive than MacOS. Here are some of the reasons why I feel that way.

Window management in Windows is way better than Mac. Windows organize better out of the box and it's just easier to create folders and navigate the file system. But I feel MacOS as a better terminal experience since it is Unix based, but as a developer you are able to accomplish just about the same tasks.

As I mentioned before, Microsoft has the best products for productivity. They have mastered the art of productivity! Microsoft Todo, Outlook, Teams, Github are so good. They aren't the best but enough to get the job done.

One other major reason why I feel Windows is better than iOS is that the snippet tool in Windows is way better than Mac. I use this feature every day by making documentation better or sharing images. It is a small thing that is a game changer between the two platforms.

The hardware argument between the two platforms is very minimal for me. The hardware is fast enough to support almost any task that I throw at it. The battery life is also enough to keep me away from the computer just enough to recharge. I would hate being in front of my computer all day. By kicking you off your computer because the battery life is low is a blessing in disguse.

## iOS vs Android

I am still figuring this one out. I will update this article when I finally have used both platforms.

## Have fun

To close, life is way too short for you to do task too intensely, It is way more fun if you are enjoying every step of the way and not taking things too seriously.

The point I want to get across is that, you can still be intense and what not doing task but you need to lighten up and have some fun. Really be in the moment. If you aren't you lose focus, this results into lower quality work and what not. 

Have fun with what you do and proceed with confidence! Be comfortable in uncomfortable situations.
