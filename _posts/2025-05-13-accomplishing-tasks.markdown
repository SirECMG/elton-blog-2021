# Tips on accomplishing task

Time in the day is so short, you can only hope to accomplish the things you set out to do. Time flies, so you have to be smart with your time.

These are some tips to getting things done that works for me.

## Switch between 2-3 tasks

The first thing I do is pick 2 or 3 things as goals for what I would like to get done in a given day. The reason is that I aim to provide impact. Trimming down the list to 2-3 days encourages me to focus and maintain my energy levels.

By focusing on 2 or 3 items and switching amongst them in order to prevent boredom really helps with momentum in getting things done. Try it out, it may or may not work for you.

## how to stay entertained but still be productive
Thing goes back to the last idea. From my experience, the longer you do the same thing over and over again the more you get bored. In order to prevent this from happening, you need to have several avenues to keep you busy. Either you can use this time to relax and enjoy the moment or you can look into doing something else and come back to the original task at hand. It is not multitasking, but keeping your mind active.

## Pomodoro Technqiue

## how I manage my energy using pomodoros
In order to keep your energy levels, you need work in burst of energies. We have seen pomodoros being used over and over again in articles. But if you actually use it in practice it helps so much. What I personally do is I devote 1 hour and 31 minutes of heads down working time, and I use 10-15 minute breaks in between to stay grounded and not get lost in tangent. This gradular approach has given me enough energy to push through for task I don't really want to do. The important thing to do is to stick with it and push through. Completely focus at the current task at hand.

## does pomodoro work?

Does it work? From my experience, by sticking with pomodoro religiously it works! On a good day you can knockout 6-8 pomodoros. And it is good for repetitive task. With harder task, you might need to have longer time durations.[text](<2021-10-24-productivity-tips copy 3.markdown>)

## Managing Notifications

Whether you have Android or iOS I leverage the fact that we have the ability to use notificaions. Notifications can be extremely useful if you curate the good and leave out the bad. What does that mean? If you only allow messages that need to reach you, it can be extremely useful for you to stay on top of things.

Having a higher level view of what is going on can be great for productivity. But don't let notifications fight for your attention. You have control over notifications. If you feel overwhelm you can mute it or clear all. The goal is to keep you in the loop. This can be down during downtimes. But the goal is to stay in control!

If you do this you can have a lot of benefits. Maybe every top of the hour can you clear out notifications.

## Accept the Identity of a Productive Person

By self proclaiming yourself as a productive person brings accountablity into play. Also, you need to convince yourself you are productive to build that character. Having confidence in yourself that you are productive also helps! Any approach helps, fake it 'til you make it! But be relentless in identifying yourself without a doubt that you are productive.

## Focus on breathing

One thing that has helped me focus and handle stressful situations is having control of your breathe. Having the ability to control your breath grounds you. I don't know the science around it but this is what I do. In order to control your breath, organically breathe in through your nose. The breathing pattern should not be forced.

Now when you exhale, make sure it is slow and long. Your exhale should be much longer than your in hale. When you can't exhale anymore provide pause and repeat the cycle again.

## Have fun

To close, life is way too short for you to do task too intensely, It is way more fun if you are enjoying every step of the way and not taking things too seriously.

The point I want to get across is that, you can still be intense and what not doing task but you need to lighten up and have some fun. Really be in the moment. If you aren't you lose focus, this results into lower quality work and what not. 

Smile while you work, don't let anyone or anything bring you down! Have fun with what you do and proceed with confidence! Be comfortable in uncomfortable situations.
