# Getting Started With Bitcoin

This section explains some platforms that I personally use in my bitcoin ecosystem.

## Exchanges

### CashApp

This is the main source of buying bitcoin. The level of accessiblity this platform provides makes it the best. They allow you to export bitcoin transaction history conviently via CSV.

They also have a direct deposit bank offering in which you can get your salary paycheck 2 days eariler than a traditional checking account.

CashApp also allows you to get a debit card in which you can spend your money and have customized coupons for Square/Block parteners. These partners include Starbucks, Shake Shack, local resturants and many different places.

### Strike

This is one of my secondary places to buy bitcoin. The reason why I don't use it as my main sources is because at the time of this writing, they do not have a good way to export transactions used for reporting taxes in the United States.

They also claim to have the lowest fees, but in practice the market price of bitcoin on this platform is much lower than other exchanges.

Despite this, I idolize the CEO for this company (Jack Mallers). He is trying to bring bitcoin to the mainstream and I'd like to support his cause, but at the current state this app is not mature enough. In the future, I will see if the platforms makes it easier for tax reporting.

### Swan Bitcoin

This is another secondary platform with a great user inteface that I use. It is only available on the web interface, but it it offers the lowest fees and has a great user friendly interface.

## Wallets (Cold Storage)

### BlueWallet

BlueWallet I mainly use for testing the waters of the lightning network. I have not needed to use the lightning network much. But this app I have on reserve for in times I need to use it.

CashApp now supports lightning network payments so I might not be needing to use this app anymore.

### Trezor Wallet

### Backing Up Private Keys


## Fiat Banking

### Charles Schwab (or your personal bank)

Charles Schwab is non-bitcoin related, but it is one of my favorite banking platforms. The investment accounts offer wide variety of stocks, etf and bonds. But most importantly, the customer service for this financial institution is top notch. The customer representatives are extremely friendly.
