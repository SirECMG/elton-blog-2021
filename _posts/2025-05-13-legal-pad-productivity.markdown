# Legal Pad

What I learned from myself over the years is that the act of writing is a powerful force for productivity. The simple act of writing has been a tool to help me think clearly. 

How you use the legal pad is up to you. You can use it to organize your thoughts, write down how you are feeling at the moment; whatever you want.

I use it to be productive. I create a todo list ideally the night before intended for the following day. But in reality, I typically create my list around 4am to 9am of the workday (yes I wake up early).

Having a piece of paper next to you while you work, acts a separate monitor or canvas to have your ideas. You are clearly able to see the current tasks and are able to take notes while conducting your work on the computer.

Typically legal pad writing is only used for short term memory since it is super easy to lose it. So I typically use it to jot down ideas or concepts and then I would need to transfer it to long term storage like on the computer. Although legal pad make good long term storage for cooking receipes.
